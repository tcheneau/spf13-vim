Plugins that I use and rationale for this fork:

== Light statusbar ==
https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim

== NERDTree + git integration ==
https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin

== Temporary workaround - Disable Omnicomplete to work around this issue (+ it fixes vim-go) ==
https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim/issues/567
(not necessary anymore, has been fixed in spf13-vim)
